targetgame
==========

A target game in python for use with foam dart guns.


targetgame vs. 
===========
For this version, I used a CD drive with motors in tact. The motors will be wired to a 9 volt battery through a 3 channel relay for reversing the polarity. I'm sure there is a better way to do this but i'm not smart.
Another "target" switch will be added to the tray. if the new target switch is not hit within the alloted time frame then the player will be "damaged" with an HP penalty.
